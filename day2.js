// Day 2: Operators

// Activities:

// Activity1: Arithmetic Opearators 

// Task1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console . 
let num1 = 24
let num2= 35
console.log(num1 + num2)

// Task2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console . 
let num3 = 35
let num4 = 24
console.log(num3 - num4)

// Task3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console . 
let num5 = 20
console.log(num5 * num4)

// Task4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console . 
let num6 = 5
console.log(num6 / num5)

// Task5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console . 
console.log(num5 % num6)

// Activity1: Assignment Opearators 

// Task6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console. 
let num7 = 21
num7 += 3
console.log(num7)

// Task7: Use the -= operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console. 
num7 -= 3
console.log(num7)

// Activity1: Comparison Opearators 

// Task8: Write a program to compare two number using > ans < and log the result to the console. 
console.log(num7 > num6)
console.log(num7 < num6)

// Task9: Write a program to compare two number using >= ans <= and log the result to the console. 
let num8 = 21
console.log(num8 >= num7)
console.log(num8 <= num2)

// Task10: Write a program to compare two number using == ans === and log the result to the console. 
let num9 = "21"
console.log(num9 == num8)
console.log(num9 === num8)

// Activity1: Logical Opearators 

// Task11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two condition and log the result to the console. 
console.log(num9 == num8 && num9 === num8)

// Task12: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two condition and log the result to the console. 
console.log(num9 == num8 || num9 === num8)

// Task13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to combine two condition and log the result to the console. 
console.log(!(num8 == num9))

// Activity1: Ternary Opearators 

// Task14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console. 
let num10 = -24
console.log((num10 > 0) ? "positive" : "negative")
